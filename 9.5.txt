1. Explain the core components of flume. 

The core components of flume are:

 1. Event
 2. Source
 3. Sink
 4. Channel
 5. Client

   Event: 
          An event is  a singular unit of data which is transported by Flume 
   Source:
         * A source is the entity through which data enters into Flume. Sources either actively poll for data or passively wait for data to be delivered to them. 
         * A variety of sources allow data to be collected, such as log4j logs and syslogs.
   Sink:
         * A sink is  the entity that delivers the data to the destination. 
         * A variety of sinks allow data to be streamed to a range of destinations.
         * One example is the HDFS sink that writes events to HDFS.
   Channel:
           A channel is the conduit between the Source and the Sink. Source ingests events into the channel and the sink drains the channel.
   Agent: 
           An agent is any physical Java virtual machine running Flume. It is a collection of sources, sinks and channels.
   Client:
           A client produces and transmits the Event to the Source operating within the Agent

2. Can flume provide 100% reliability while transfering the data.

Flume can guarantee that all data received by an agent node will eventually make it to the collector at the end of its flow as long as the agent node keeps running, 
which means data can be reliably delivered to its eventual destination.
The end-to-end reliability level guarantees that once Flume accepts an event, that event will make it to the endpoint as long as the agent that accepted the event remains live long enough.
Even when using the end-to-end reliability level, a Flume flow can fail to make progress if there aren’t any nodes available to process events.

 3. Explain the consolidation in flume. 

   * Consolidation collects data from different sources even from different flume agents. 
   * Flume source can collect all data from different sources and flows through channel and sink. 
   * Finally sends this data to HDFS or target destination.

4. Explain what is an event in flume.

   * An event is the basic unit of the data transported inside Flume. 
   * It contains a payload of byte array that is to be transported from the source to the destination accompanied by optional headers.
   * A Flume agent is a (JVM) process that hosts the components through which events flow from an external source to the next destination (hop).

 5. Explain what is an agent in flume.

   * An agent is an independent daemon process (JVM) in Flume. 
   * It receives data  from clients or other agents and forwards it to its next destination (sink or agent). 
   * Flume may have more than 1 agent.
